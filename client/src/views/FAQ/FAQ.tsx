              <span>Flavor is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a rebasing mechanism to raise funds for a treasury managed by the community. The community can then use those funds via Flavor governance to build out the protocol.</span>

              <span>Flavor is the governance token for the Flavor protocol. Using token voting, Flavor holders have direct influence over the Flavor treasury and direction of the protocol. Governance discussions take place on the <ExternalLink href="https://forum.Flavor.finance/">Flavor Governance Forum.</ExternalLink></span>

              slug="rebase"
            >
              <span>Rebases occur every 12 hours. In order to target a price of 1 yUSD, Flavor supply is either increased or decreased during each rebase. In theory, an increase in supply would put downward pressure on price towards 1 and a decrease in supply would put upward pressure on price towards 1.</span>
              <span>If Flavor price is above 1.05 yUSD, Flavor supply increases. This is known as a positive rebase.</span>
              <span>If Flavor price is below 0.95 yUSD, Flavor supply decreases. This is known as a negative rebase.</span>
              <span>If Flavor price is between 0.95 and 1.05 yUSD, Flavor does not rebase.</span>
              <span>Every Flavor holder gets the same increase or decrease in supply every rebase. However, this increase or decrease is offset by the subsequent increase or decrease in price.</span>

              question="What is the math behind each rebase?"
              slug="rebase-math"
            >
              <span>Flavor does not try to target $1 all at once, instead attempting to do it over 10 rebase periods.</span>
              <span>To calculate change in supply we need to determine how far from the peg the current price is. This formula is:</span>
              <code>
                Deviation from peg = (Current Price - Target Price) / Target Price
                <br />
                Rebase Amount = Current Supply * (Deviation From Peg/10)
                <br />
                New Supply = Current supply + Rebase Amount
              </code>

              question="Does this mean I gain or lose money every rebase?"
              slug="rebase-supply"
            >
              <span>No. The Uniswap liquidity pools are in sync with every rebase. This means that if supply is increased by 20% in a rebase, price will drop 20% to offset it. </span>
              <span>Imagine the following scenario. Flavor is at $2 and you hold 100 Flavor. This means your Flavor holdings are $200. A rebase comes and it's a positive 20% rebase. You now have 120 Flavor but the price will go $1.67, so your Flavor holdings are still worth $200!</span>

              slug="treasury"
            >
              <span>Every positive rebase, the treasury mints 10% of the rebase amount and sells Flavor to the Flavor/yUSD Uniswap pool. The yUSD acquired through this action is sent to the treasury which is managed by Flavor holders. The current treasury amount can be seen on Flavor.finance.</span>

              <span>Yes. Currently, youâ€™re able to earn Flavor rewards by providing liquidity to the <ExternalLink href="https://uniswap.info/pair/0xb93Cc05334093c6B3b8Bfd29933bb8d5C031caBC">yUSD/Flavor Uniswap pool</ExternalLink>. The rewards given to the pool are 92,500 in week 1, decreasing by 10% every week after. Please realize that you must apply the Flavor scaling factor to get the current reward amount at any given time.</span>

              slug="scaling-factor"
            >
              <span>Because Flavor supply is constantly changing due to rebases, itâ€™s hard to keep up with the ever changing supply amount. Flavor.finance provides a scaling factor that you can use which allows you to go from initial Flavor v3 supply amount to todayâ€™s supply amount.</span>

Users are able to deposit yCRV (generated <ExternalLink href="https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit">here</ExternalLink>) into the vaults which then yield interest on the deposit over time.</span>
